.SH NAME
ssocr \- optical recognition of seven segment displays
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ssocr [OPTION]... [COMMAND]... IMAGE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ssocr
reads an image file containing the picture of a seven segment display,
recognizes the displayed digits and prints them to standard output.
All image formats known by imlib2 are supported.
Use
.B -
as file name to read the image from standard input.
.B ssocr
provides several image manipulation algorithms to enhance noisy images.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS -h, --help
Write a help message to standard output.
The default settings are shown as well.
.SS -V, --version
Write version information to standard output.
.SS -v, --verbose
Print information about program execution to standard error.
.SS -t, --threshold THRESHOLD
Specify a percentage value as luminance threshold to differentiate between
black and white. This threshold is adjusted to the luminance values occurring
in the image, unless option
.B --absolute-threshold
is used. The default threshold is
.IR 50 .
.SS -a, --absolute-threshold
Do not adjust the threshold to the luminance values occuring in the image.
.SS -T, --iter-threshold
Use an iterative method (one-dimensional k-means clustering) to determine the
threshold. The starting value can be specified with the
.B --threshold
option.
.SS -n, --number-pixels NUMBER
Set the number of foreground pixels that have to be found in a scanline to
recognize a segment.
Can be used to ignore some noise in the picture.
See the web page of
.BR ssocr (1)
for a description of the algorithm.
.SS -i, --ignore-pixels NUMBER
Set the number of foreground pixels that are ignored when deciding if a column
consists only of background or foreground pixels.
Can be used to ignore some noise in the picture.
See the web page of
.BR ssocr (1)
for a description of the algorithm.
.SS -d, --number-digits NUMBER
Specifies the number of digits shown in the image. Default value is
.IR 6 .
Use
.I -1
to automatically detect the number of digits.
.SS -r, --one-ratio RATIO
Set the height/width ratio threshold to recognize a digit as a one.
RATIO takes integers only.
See the web page of
.BR ssocr (1)
for a description of the algorithm.
.SS -o, --output-image FILE
Write the processed image to FILE.
Use
.B -
to write to standard output.
Unless this option is used no image is written to disk.
If a standard filename extension is used it is interpreted as the image
format to use.
Can be useful together with the
.B --process-only
option.
.SS -O, --output-format FORMAT
Specify the image format to use with
.BR --output-image .
This format must be recognized by imlib2.
Standard filename extensions are used to describe the format.
Overwrites the image file format automatically determined via the filename.
If no format is specified via this option or the filename,
.IR png
is used.
.SS -p, --process-only
Use
.BR ssocr (1)
as an image manipulation program.
No image recognition is performed.
Should be used together with the
-B --output-image
option.
.SS -D, --debug-image[=FILE]
Write a debug image showing the results of thresholding, segmentation and
character recognition to disk.
The image is written to the file
.I testbild.png
unless a filename
.B FILE
is given.
.SS -P, --debug-output
Print information helpful for debugging to standard error.
.SS -f, --foreground COLOR
Specify the foreground color (either
.I black
or
.IR white ).
This automatically sets the background color as well.
Default is
.IR black .
.SS -b, --background COLOR
Specify the background color (either
.I black
or
.IR white ).
This automatically sets the foreground color as well.
Default is
.IR white .
.SS -I, --print-info
Prints image dimensions and range of used luminance values to standard error.
.SS -g, --adjust-gray
Interpret the values
.B T1
and
.B T2
given to the command
.B gray_stretch
as percentages instead of absolut luminance values.
.SS -l, --luminance KEYWORD
Choose the type of luminace computation.
Using
.I help
as
.B KEYWORD
prints the list of implemented luminance keywords with a short description of
the used formula.
The default of
.I Rec709
should work well in most cases.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS dilation
Filter image using dilation algorithm.
Any pixel with at least one neighbour pixel set in the source image will be
set in the filtered image.
.SS erosion
Filter image using erosion algorithm.
Any pixel with every neighbour pixel set in the source image will be set
in the filtered image.
.SS closing [N]
Filter image using closing algorithm, i.e. erosion and then dilation.
If a number
.B N
>
.I 1
is specified,
.B N
times dilation and then
.B N
times erosion is executed.
.SS opening [N]
Filter image using opening algorithm, i.e. dilation and then erosion.
If a number
.B N
>
.I 1
is specified,
.B N
times dilation and then
.B N
times erosion is executed.
.SS remove_isolated
Remove any foreground pixels without neighbouring foreground pixels.
.SS make_mono
Convert the image to monochrome using thresholding.
The threshold can be specified with option
.B --threshold
and is adjusted to the used luminance interval of the image unless option
.B --absolute-threshold
is used.
.SS grayscale
Transform image to gray values using luminance.
The formula to compute luminance can be specified using option
.BR --luminance .
.SS invert
Set every foreground pixel to background color and vice versa.
.SS gray_stretch T1 T2
Transform image so that the luminance interval [
.BR T1 , T2
] is projected to [
.IR 0 , 255
] with any value below
.B T1
set to
.I 0
and any value above
.B T2
set to
.IR 255 .
.SS dynamic_threshold W H
Convert the image to monochrome using dynamic thresholding a.k.a local
adaptive thresholding.
A window of width W  and height H around the current pixel is used to determine
the (local) thresholding value.
.SS rgb_threshold
Convert the image to monochrome using simple thresholding for every color
channel.
This is the same as
.B --luminance=minimum make_mono.
You should use
.B --luminance=minimum
and
.B make_mono
or
.B dynamic_threshold
instead.
.SS r_threshold
Convert the image to monochrome using simple thresholding.
Only the red color channel is used.
This is the same as
.B --luminance=red make_mono.
You should use
.B --luminance red
and
.B make_mono
or
.B dynamic_threshold
instead.
.SS g_threshold
Convert the image to monochrome using simple thresholding.
Only the green color channel is used.
This is the same as
.B --luminance=green make_mono.
You should use
.B --luminance green
and
.B make_mono
or
.B dynamic_threshold
instead.
.SS b_threshold
Convert the image to monochrome using simple thresholding.
Only the blue color channel is used.
This is the same as
.B --luminance=blue make_mono.
You should use
.B --luminance blue
and
.B make_mono
or
.B dynamic_threshold
instead.
.SS white_border [WIDTH]
The border of the image is set to the foreground color.
This border is one pixel wide unless a
.B WIDTH
>
.I 1
is specified.
.SS shear OFFSET
Shear the image
.B OFFSET
pixels to the right.
The
.B OFFSET
is used at the bottom.
Image dimensions do not change,
pixels in background color are used for pixels that are outside the image
and shifted inside.
Pixels shifted out of the image are dropped.
Many seven segment displays use slightly skewed digits,
this command can be used to compensate this.
.SS rotate THETA
Rotate the image
.B THETA
degrees clockwise around the center of the image.
Image dimensions do not change,
pixels rotated out of the image area are dropped,
pixels from outside the image rotated into the new image are set to the
background color.
.SS crop X Y W H
Use only the subpicture with upper left corner (
.BR X , Y
), width
.B W
and height
.BR H .
.SS set_pixels_filter MASK
Set every pixel in the filtered image that has at least
.B MASK
neighbour pixels set in the source image.
.SS keep_pixels_filter MASK
Keep only those foreground pixels in the filtered image that have at least
.B MASK
neighbour pixels set in the source image (not counting the checked pixel itself).
